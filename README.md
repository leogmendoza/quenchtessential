# üå±Quenchtessential: IoT Plant Watering and Monitoring

> Water _quenches_ the thirst of plants, thus it is _quintessential_.

## üßê What?
Quenchtessential is an ESP32-based IoT solution built to automatically water my houseplant while monitoring its health through a full-stack [dashboard app](https://leogmendoza.github.io/quenchtessential/)! 

## üò± Why? 
Life is busy as an eng student, so I don't want my plant to feel neglected.. Also, I was inspired by my previous company [Xandar Kardian](https://xkcorp.com/) and their vital sign sensor hardware + remote _patient_ monitoring software solution and have been meaning to clone it mwuahahahaaahüòà

## ‚≠ê Features
- **Automated Watering**:  
  Uses an FSM to pump water and feed the plant when the moisture sensor says it meets the "thirsty threshold"

- **Live Health Monitoring**:  
  Displays real-time and historical moisture data on a modern web dashboard for trend visualization
  
- **WiFi-enabled**:  
  Connects to a network (w/o hardcoding credentials) using a captive portal and talks to the backend via MQTT
  
- **Plug-and-Play**:  
  Deployed & cloud-hosted full-stack app and wall-powered, so no local setup needed--as if it was a real product!

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture
