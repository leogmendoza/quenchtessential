## Why? 
Life is busy as an eng student, so I don't want my plant to feel neglected.. Also, I was inspired by my previous company Xandar Kardian's sensor hardware + remote patient monitoring software solution and wanna try cloning it mwaahhahaðŸ¤«

## Currently . . .
Building the full-stack app to support the ESP32!!
