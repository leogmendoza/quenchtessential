# Quenchtessential: Remote Plant Monitoring
Water _quenches_ the thirst of plants, so it is _quintessential_.

## Why? 
Life is busy as an eng student, so I don't want my plant to feel neglected.. Also, I was inspired by my previous company Xandar Kardian's sensor hardware + remote patient monitoring software solution and wanna try cloning it mwaahhahaðŸ¤«

## Currently . . .
Building a full-stack app to support the ESP32!!
